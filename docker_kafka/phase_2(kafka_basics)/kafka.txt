-Apache Kafka is a tool that lets different apps send messages to each other reliably and quickly — like a real-time message hub.

-Kafka in Action
Kafka is used as a message hub between them:

User places an order ➡️
The User App sends a message: "Order #123 placed"
This message goes to Kafka.

Kafka stores the message 📨
Like a mailbox, Kafka keeps this message safe.

Restaurant App reads the message from Kafka 🍔
It sees: "Order #123 placed" and starts preparing the food.

Delivery App reads another message from Kafka 🛵
Later, it sees: "Order #123 ready for delivery".

Tracking App shows updates from Kafka 🗺️
It shows: "Order picked up", "Order on the way", etc.

-(producer_json, consumer_json_logger)
-(producer_json,consmer_db_logger,dashbord.py) so for this the producer sends the message,stored in the topic and recived by consumer and it will store in the database,and streamlit is used to display the message
