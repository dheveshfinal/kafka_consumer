docker: mean it create an package for the project and use container to run the app, the benefit is it provide free memory and can run anywhere in the system

docker file: it is the list that contain all the dependency of the project like what library that need to download and how to run the app(cmd ["python","app.py"]) and which python version 
that we are using(FROM python:3.12.4)

docker image: it is one which follow the dockerfile instruction and store all the code, library, version in it
creating(docker build -t image_name)

docker container: it is the one used for actual running of the application using docker image cmd(docker run -name container_name docker_name),it is reated when we run the command 

docker volume: mean it stores the data outside the container and don't get deleted even if the container stop running
